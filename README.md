# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains all the coding projects, assignments, and challenges completed throughout my JavaScript course.

The purpose of this repository is to store and organize my work in one central location so my instructor can review my progress and provide feedback.

Throughout the course, I will regularly push new code to this repository. No code will be deleted unless explicitly instructed, as all submissions may be required for grading.

This repository also serves as part of my online portfolio and demonstrates my experience using GitHub, version control, and JavaScript fundamentals.

## Contents
